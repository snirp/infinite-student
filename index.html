<h1>The infinite student</h1>
<p>
  This page is central to my quest to learn (Python) programming.
  It reflects my conviction that the best way to learn is by
  constantly and endlessly challenging myself.
</p>
<p>
  It has been said that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to truely
  master any skill. That is very unsatisfactory to me. First because
  I think that mastery comes more with the quality of the practice than
  the duration of the pactice. Secondly there is no reason to believe
  that a 'magic' number like 10,000 hours exists. Are you 'done' after
  that? Have you run out of challenges? Now that is a depressing thought.
</p>
<p>
  So here is what I propose and will execute to teach myself programming:
  <ol>
    <li>Formulate challenges that are tough and fun;</li>
    <li>Use the best resources;</li>
    <li>Explain, publish and discuss everything;</li>
    <li>Keep regularly spending time on it: I am never done.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h1>This website</h1>
<p>
  This website itself is the first of the challenges. I needed something
  that supports my mission, keeps it organized but does not get in the way.
</p>
<p>
  On the one hand there is a list of challenges. This list is ever-growing
  and most of them should look impossible to me right now. Perfect. Any challenge
  should have goals ("Build a search engine") and resources ("<a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/">Anatomy of a Web Search
  Engine</a>, by L. Page and S. Brin"). Learn from the best :). I might not
  get around to getting all challenges done. Hopefully because I will learn
  so quickly that some seem "easy" and not worthwhile. Yep, let's hope.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, we have the projects themselves: challenges that are
  (partly) finished and, most importantly, well documented. In fact, the
  code itself is published as examples of (semi-)literate programming. Every
  new project and change is automatically published and open for discussion.
</p>
<p>
  The website works as a 'static site generator' in which the code files are
  the flatpages. A special comment-tag indicates what comments should be parsed
  as YAML metadata and HTML (from Markdown). This limits the projects to
  single files, but I think that would cover most of it.
</p>

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am Roy Prins, 35 years old, and I have no formal background in programming.
  I run a one-person consultancy firm: <a href="http://snirp.nl">Snirp</a> and
  my mind is always full of stuff to improve and build. I see no reason that is
  ever going to change and I think that being a good programmer would go a long
  way to help me build the stuff.
</p>

<h1>Challenge me</h1>
<p>
  So I like a good challenge, in fact I need them. I welcome any idea or challenge.
  Maybe something you are stuck with or something that would surely be impossible
  for me to accomplish. Just start typing to challenge me.
